# Milk_production-forecasting-using-time-series-ARMA-
 A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model will be used to forecast the milk production for next 2 years.

 # Problem Statement:

 Milk is one of the most important and widely consumed agricultural products in the world. It is not only a significant source of nutrition but also plays a crucial role in the global economy. Accurate forecasting of milk production is therefore essential for dairy farmers, milk processing companies, and policymakers to make informed decisions. 
By using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, forecasting milk production can help to optimize production processes, reduce wastage, and ensure a stable supply of milk in the market. 
In this project, you must explore the different methods used for forecasting milk production and the importance of accurate forecasting in the dairy industry.
